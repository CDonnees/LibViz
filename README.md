Making graphs you can play with from Zotero libraries..
-------------------------------------------------------
----------- VERSION IN DEVELOPMENT !!! ----------------
-------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------
PRESENTATION
-------------------------------------------------------
LibViz allows to generate data visualisations (graphs) from sets of Zotero references.
HISTORY

LibViz started as a part of 1.CAMP, which a larger project aiming to cross different topics as the anthropocene era, art, new practices, scientific research, ... Julien Bellanger could tell more about this part...

Then other people join the project, wanting some visualisation for their own datasets : other bibliographical references gathered in Zotero. So the project eventually aimed to be as 'neutral' as possible to accept any kind of dataset from Zotero.

-------------------------------------------------------
UNDER THE HOOD
-------------------------------------------------------

LibViz development is documented HERE and on GitHub.

LibViz is powered by :

    Python to get the references and create the JSON datasets
    Zotero to organise bibliographical references
    Flask as backbone of the website
    Bootstrap for the global aspect website
    d3.js by
    Mike Bostock to create the graph visualisation
