As of 2009 it ranked third in seeds and biotechnology sales. Sales in 2015 were approximately US$13.4 billion, over half of which were in emerging markets.\nIn February 2016, ChemChina agreed a $43 billion bid for Swiss seeds and pesticides group Syngenta, the largest ever foreign purchase by a Chinese firm. The deal is awaiting approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and European government panels, citing food safety and security concerns. In June 2016, both companies refiled the transaction for CFIUS approval, forcing them to restart the application process.",

Further, human have significant exposure to phthalates. However, little is known concerning the exposure of wildlife to phthalates. We report urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations from fifty juvenile alligators from three Florida lakes and a site in the Everglades. Urinary phthalate monoester concentrations varied widely among alligators from the different sites but also among alligators from the same site. Mono-2-ethylhexy phthalate and monobutyl phthalate were found in most samples of alligator urine with maximums of 35,700 ng/mL and 193 ng/mL, respectively. Monobenzyl phthalate was found in 5 alligators with a maximum of 66.7 ng/mL. Other monoesters were found in only one or two alligator urine samples. The wide variation within and among sites, in addition to the high levels of mEHP, mBP and mBzP, is consistent with exposure arising from the intermittent spraying of herbicide formulations to control invasive aquatic plants in Florida freshwater sites. Phthalate diesters are used as adjuvants in many of these formulations.",

The book documented the detrimental effects on the environment\u2014particularly on birds\u2014of the indiscriminate use of pesticides. Carson accused the chemical industry of spreading disinformation and public officials of accepting industry claims unquestioningly.\nIn the late 1950s, Carson turned her attention to conservation, especially environmental problems that she believed were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result was Silent Spring (1962), which brought environmental concerns to the American public. Silent Spring was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, but it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, led to a nationwide ban on DDT for agricultural uses, and inspired an environmental movement that led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nIn 1996, a follow-up book, Beyond Silent Spring, co-written by H.F. van Emden and David Peakall, was published. In 2006, Silent Spring was named one of the 25 greatest science books of all time by the editors of Discover Magazine.",

The enzyme 5\u03b1-reductase synthesizes DHT from testosterone in the prostate, testes, hair follicles, and adrenal glands. This enzyme reduces the 4,5 double-bond of the testosterone. Relative to testosterone, DHT is much more potent as an agonist of the androgen receptor.\nDHT is also known as androstanolone (INN) and stanolone (BAN), and is used clinically under brand names including Anabolex, Anaprotin, Andractim, Androlone, Gelovit, Neoprol, Pesomax, and Stanaprol as an androgen and anabolic steroid.

It was first introduced, as Delestrogen by Squibb in the United States, in 1954, and along with estradiol benzoate (1936) and estradiol cypionate (1952), has since become one of the most widely used esters of estradiol.\nUpon ingestion, regardless of the route of administration, estradiol valerate behaves as a prodrug, being cleaved by esterases in blood plasma and the liver into 17\u03b2-estradiol and valeric acid. However, compared to estradiol itself, estradiol valerate is absorbed more slowly and possesses a longer duration, especially when given in an oil solution via intramuscular injection (in which it acts as a depot). As a result, it can be administered less frequently.\nA single intramuscular injection of 4 mg estradiol valerate results in maximal plasma levels of estradiol of about 390 pg/mL within three days of administration, with levels declining to 100 pg/mL by 12\u201313 days. A study of high-dose combined administration of 40 mg estradiol valerate and 250 mg hydroxyprogesterone caproate in women once weekly for six months (described as a \"pseudopregnancy\" regimen) found that serum levels of estradiol increased from 27.8\u201334.8 pg/mL to 3028\u20133226 pg/mL after three months and to 2491\u20132552 pg/mL after six months of treatment.",

Because of their longevity, PCBs are still widely in use, even though their manufacture has declined drastically since the 1960s, when a host of problems were identified. Because of PCBs' environmental toxicity and classification as a persistent organic pollutant, PCB production was banned by the United States Congress in 1979 and by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001. The International Research Agency on Cancer (IRAC), rendered PCBs as definite carcinogens in humans. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), PCBs cause cancer in animals and are probable human carcinogens. Many rivers and buildings including schools, parks, and other sites are contaminated with PCBs, and there have been contaminations of food supplies with the toxins.\nSome PCBs share a structural similarity and toxic mode of action with dioxin. Other toxic effects such as endocrine disruption (notably blocking of thyroid system functioning) and neurotoxicity are known. The maximum allowable contaminant level in drinking water in the United States is set at zero, but because of water treatment technologies, a level of 0.5 parts per billion is the de facto level.\nThe bromine analogues of PCBs are polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), which have analogous applications and environmental concerns.",

DDT has been formulated in multiple forms, including solutions in xylene or petroleum distillates, emulsifiable concentrates, water-wettable powders, granules, aerosols, smoke candles and charges for vaporizers and lotions.\nFirst synthesized in 1874, DDT's insecticidal action was discovered by the Swiss chemist Paul Hermann M\u00fcller in 1939. It was used in the second half of World War II to control malaria and typhus among civilians and troops. After the war, DDT was also used as an agricultural insecticide and its production and use duly increased. M\u00fcller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for his discovery of the high efficiency of DDT as a contact poison against several arthropods\" in 1948.\nIn 1962, Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring was published. It cataloged the environmental impacts of widespread DDT spraying in the United States and questioned the logic of releasing large amounts of potentially dangerous chemicals into the environment without understanding their effects on the environment or human health. The book claimed that DDT and other pesticides had been shown to cause cancer and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife, particularly birds. Its publication was a seminal event for the environmental movement and resulted in a large public outcry that eventually led, in 1972, to a ban on DDT's agricultural use in the United States. A worldwide ban on agricultural use was formalized under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, but its limited and still-controversial use in disease vector control continues, because of its effectiveness in reducing malarial infections, balanced by environmental and other health concerns.\nAlong with the passage of the Endangered Species Act, the United States ban on DDT is cited by scientists as a major factor in the comeback of the bald eagle (the national bird of the United States) and the peregrine falcon from near-extinction in the contiguous United States.",

Epoxy resins containing BPA are used to line water pipes, as coatings on the inside of many food and beverage cans and in making thermal paper such as that used in sales receipts. In 2011, an estimated 10 billion pounds of BPA chemical were produced for manufacturing polycarbonate plastic, making it one of the highest volume of chemicals produced worldwide.\nBPA exhibits hormone-like properties that raise concern about its suitability in some consumer products and food containers. Since 2008, several governments have investigated its safety, which prompted some retailers to withdraw polycarbonate products. The FDA has ended its authorization of the use of BPA in baby bottles and infant formula packaging, based on market abandonment, not safety. The European Union and Canada have banned BPA use in baby bottles.\nThe FDA states \"BPA is safe at the current levels occurring in foods\" based on extensive research, including two more studies issued by the agency in early 2014. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed new scientific information on BPA in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2015: EFSA\u2019s experts concluded on each occasion that they could not identify any new evidence which would lead them to revise their opinion that the known level of exposure to BPA is safe; however, the EFSA does recognize some uncertainties, and will continue to investigate them.\nIn February 2016, France announced that it intends to propose BPA as a REACH Regulation candidate substance of very high concern (SVHC).",

In humans and other mammals, testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and, to a lesser extent, the ovaries of females. Small amounts are also secreted by the adrenal glands. It is the principal male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid.\nIn men, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as the testis and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair. In addition, testosterone is essential for health and well-being, and for the prevention of osteoporosis.\nOn average, in adult males, levels of testosterone are about 7\u20138 times as great as in adult females. As the metabolic consumption of testosterone in males is greater, the daily production is about 20 times greater in men. Females are also more sensitive to the hormone. Testosterone is observed in most vertebrates. Fish make a slightly different form called 11-ketotestosterone. Its counterpart in insects is ecdysone. These ubiquitous steroids suggest that sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history.\nTestosterone is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.",

In men, estrone has been known to cause anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and erectile dysfunction. Estrone is relevant to health and disease states because of its conversion to estrone sulfate, a long-lived derivative. Estrone sulfate acts as a reservoir that can be converted as needed to the more active estradiol.

      "abstractNote": "Estradiol, or more precisely, 17\u03b2-estradiol, is a steroid and estrogen sex hormone, and the primary female sex hormone. It is named for and is important in the regulation of the estrous and menstrual female reproductive cycles. Estradiol is essential for the development and maintenance of female reproductive tissues but it also has important effects in many other tissues including bone. While estrogen levels in men are lower compared to women, estrogens have essential functions in men as well. Estradiol is found in most vertebrates as well as many crustaceans, insects, fish, and other animal species.\nEstradiol or oestradiol (American or British English usages), derives from estra-, Gk. \u03bf\u1f36\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (oistros, literally meaning \"verve or inspiration\") and -diol, a chemical name and suffix indicating that this form of steroid and sex hormone is a type of alcohol bearing two hydroxyl groups.\nEstradiol is produced especially within the follicles of the female ovaries, but also in other endocrine (i.e., hormone-producing) and non-endocrine tissues (e.g., including fat, liver, adrenal, breast, and neural tissues). Estradiol is biosynthesized from progesterone (arrived at in two steps from cholesterol, via intermediate pregnenolone). One principal pathway then converts progesterone to its 17-hydroxy derivative, 17-Hydroxyprogesterone, and then to \u03944-androstenedione via sequential cytochrome P450-catalyzed oxidations. Action of aromatase on \u03944-androstenedione generates estrone, and action of a dehydrogenase on this gives the title compound, 17\u03b2-estradiol. Alternatively, \u03944-androstenedione can be converted into the androgen, testosterone, which in turn can be converted directly into 17\u03b2-estradiol.",

Studies suggest it is an endocrine disruptor, an agent that can alter the natural hormonal system. In 2006 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had stated that under the Food Quality Protection Act \"the risks associated with the pesticide residues pose a reasonable certainty of no harm\", and in 2007, the EPA said that atrazine does not adversely affect amphibian sexual development and that no additional testing was warranted. EPA\u00b4s 2009 review  concluded that \"the agency\u2019s scientific bases for its regulation of atrazine are robust and ensure prevention of exposure levels that could lead to reproductive effects in humans.\" EPA started a registration review in 2013.\nThe EPA's review has been criticized, and the safety of atrazine remains controversial.",

      "abstractNote": "Phthalates (pronounced /\u02c8\u03b8\u00e6\u02ccle\u026ats/ or in British English /\u02c8(f)\u03b8ale\u026ats/), or phthalate esters, are esters of phthalic acid and are mainly used as plasticizers (substances added to plastics to increase their flexibility, transparency, durability, and longevity). Phthalates are manufactured by reacting phthalic anhydride with alcohol(s) that range from methanol and ethanol (C1/C2) up to tridecyl alcohol (C13), either as a straight chain or with some branching. They are divided into two distinct groups, with very different applications, toxicological properties, and classification, based on the number of carbon atoms in their alcohol chain. They are used primarily to soften polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Lower-molecular-weight phthalates (3-6 carbon atoms in their backbone) are being gradually replaced in many products in the United States, Canada, and European Union over health concerns. They are replaced by high-molecular-weight phthalates (those with more than 6 carbons in their backbone, which gives them increased permanency and durability). In 2010, the market was still dominated by high-phthalate plasticizers; however, due to legal provisions and growing environmental awareness and perceptions, producers are increasingly forced to use non-phthalate plasticizers.\nPhthalates are used in a wide range of common products, and are released into the environment. There is no covalent bond between the phthalates and plastics; rather, they are entangled within the plastic as a result of the manufacturing process used to make PVC articles. They can be removed by exposure to heat or with organic solvents. Due to the ubiquity of plastics (and therefore plasticizers) in modern life, the vast majority of people are exposed to some level of phthalates, and most Americans tested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have metabolites of multiple phthalates in their urine. Phthalate exposure may be through direct use or by indirect means through leaching and general environmental contamination. Diet is believed to be the main source of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and other phthalates in the general population. Fatty foods such as milk, butter, and meats are a major source. In studies of rodents exposed to certain phthalates, high doses have been shown to change hormone levels and cause birth defects.",

Climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions, or in the time variation of weather around longer-term average conditions (i.e., more or fewer extreme weather events). Climate change is caused by factors such as biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics, and volcanic eruptions. Certain human activities have also been identified as significant causes of recent climate change, often referred to as global warming.\nScientists actively work to understand past and future climate by using observations and theoretical models. A climate record\u2014extending deep into the Earth's past\u2014has been assembled, and continues to be built up, based on geological evidence from borehole temperature profiles, cores removed from deep accumulations of ice, floral and faunal records, glacial and periglacial processes, stable-isotope and other analyses of sediment layers, and records of past sea levels. More recent data are provided by the instrumental record. General circulation models, based on the physical sciences, are often used in theoretical approaches to match past climate data, make future projections, and link causes and effects in climate change.",

While there are competing views as to an exact definition, the interplay between environmental issues and social indicators are key to its understanding.\nThe primary contention issue in the definition is intent. Some definitions hold that only intentional discrimination against minorities in issues regarding the environment is what constitutes environmental racism, while others focus on the presence of unfavorable environmental conditions for minorities, intentional or not. A significant factor in creation of effective environmental segregation is the fact that low-income communities lack the organization and political power to resist introduction of dangerous technologies, as well as greater mobility of richer citizens away from areas falling into industrial and environmental decline.\nHistorically, the term is tied to the environmental justice movement that took place in the 1970s and 80s in the United States. There is much discourse on environmental racism in the U.S., and while many of its cases are documented in great detail, focus on cases from other countries is important to have and should be highlighted as well.\nOn the international level, policies that have been described as environmental racism included first world corporations exporting dirty technologies, dangerous chemicals or waste materials banned by the domestic laws to developing countries, with lax environmental policies and safety practices (pollution havens).",

      "abstractNote": "Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that, at certain doses, can interfere with endocrine (or hormone) systems. These disruptions can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, and other developmental disorders. Any system in the body controlled by hormones can be derailed by hormone disruptors. Specifically, endocrine disruptors may be associated with the development of learning disabilities, severe attention deficit disorder, cognitive and brain development problems; deformations of the body (including limbs); breast cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid and other cancers; sexual development problems such as feminizing of males or masculinizing effects on females, etc. Recently The Endocrine Society released a statement on Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) specifically listing obesity, diabetes, female reproduction, male reproduction, hormone-sensitive cancers in females, prostate cancer in males, thyroid, and neurodevelopment and neuroendocrine systems as being affected biological aspects of being exposed to EDCs. The critical period of development for most organisms is between the transition from a fertilized egg into a fully formed infant. As the cells begin to grow and differentiate, there are critical balances of hormones and protein changes that must occur. Therefore, a dose of disrupting chemicals may do substantial damage to a developing fetus. The same dose may not significantly affect adult mothers.\nThere has been controversy over endocrine disruptors, with some groups calling for swift action by regulators to remove them from the market, and regulators and other scientists calling for further study. Some endocrine disruptors have been identified and removed from the market (for example, a drug called diethylstilbestrol), but it is uncertain whether some endocrine disruptors on the market actually harm humans and wildlife at the doses to which wildlife and humans are exposed. Additionally, a key scientific paper, published in the journal Science, which helped launch the movement of those opposed to endocrine disruptors, was retracted and its author found to have committed scientific misconduct.\nFound in many household and industrial products, endocrine disruptors are substances that \"interfere with the synthesis, secretion, transport, binding, action, or elimination of natural hormones in the body that are responsible for development, behavior, fertility, and maintenance of homeostasis (normal cell metabolism).\" They are sometimes also referred to as hormonally active agents, endocrine disrupting chemicals, or endocrine disrupting compounds.\nStudies in cells and laboratory animals have shown that EDCs can cause adverse biological effects in animals, and low-level exposures may also cause similar effects in human beings. The term endocrine disruptor is often used as synonym for xenohormone although the latter can mean any naturally occurring or artificially produced compound showing hormone-like properties (usually binding to certain hormonal receptors). EDCs in the environment may also be related to reproductive and infertility problems in wildlife and bans and restrictions on their use has been associated with a reduction in health problems and the recovery of some wildlife populations.",

      "abstractNote": "INTRODUCTION: Prenatal exposure to some pesticides can adversely affect male reproductive health in animals. We investigated a possible human association between maternal exposure to 27 organochlorine compounds used as pesticides and cryptorchidism among male children.\nDESIGN: Within a prospective birth cohort, we performed a case-control study; 62 milk samples from mothers of cryptorchid boys and 68 from mothers of healthy boys were selected. Milk was collected as individual pools between 1 and 3 months postpartum and analyzed for 27 organochlorine pesticides.\nRESULTS: Eight organochlorine pesticides were measurable in all samples (medians; nanograms per gram lipid) for cases/controls: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p -DDE) : 97.3/83.8; beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH) : 13.6/12.3; hexachlorobenzene (HCB) : 10.6/8.8; alpha-endosulfan: 7.0/6.7; oxychlordane: 4.5/4.1; 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethane (p,p -DDT) : 4.6/4.0; dieldrin: 4.1/3.1 ; cis-heptachloroepoxide (cis-HE) : 2.5/2.2. Five compounds [octachlorostyrene (OCS); pentachlorobenzene, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethane(p,p -DDD) ; o,p -DDT ; mirex] were measurable in most samples (detection rates 90.8-99.2%) but in lower concentrations. For methoxychlor, cis-chlordane, pentachloroanisole (PCA), gamma-HCH, 1,1-dichloro-2-(2-chlorophenyl) -2,2(4-chlorophenyl) ethane, trans-chlordane, alpha-HCH, and o,p -DDE, both concentrations and detection rates were low (26.5-71.5%). Heptachlor, HCH (lc delta, epsilon), aldrin, beta-endosulfan and trans-heptachloroepoxide were detected at negligible concentrations and low detection rates and were not analyzed further. Seventeen of 21 organochlorine pesticides [p,p -DDT, p,p-DDE, p,p-DDD, o,p-DDT, HCH (alpha, beta, gamma), HCB, PCA, alpha-endosulfan, cis-HE, chlordane (cis-, trans-) oxychlordane, methoxychlor, OCS, and dieldrin] were measured in higher median concentrations in case milk than in control milk. Apart from trans-chlordane (p = 0.012), there were no significant differences between cryptorchid and healthy boys for individual chemicals. However, combined statistical analysis of the eight most abundant persistent pesticides showed that pesticide levels in breast milk were significantly higher in boys with cryptorchidism (p = 0.032).\nCONCLUSION: The association between congenital cryptorchidism and some persistent pesticides in breast milk as a proxy for maternal exposure suggests that testicular descent in the fetus may be adversely affected.",

Bisphenol A (BPA), a monomer of polycarbonate and epoxy resins, has been detected in canned food and human saliva. BPA stimulates cell proliferation and induces expression of estrogen-responsive genes in vitro, albeit with a relatively low potency. In vivo, BPA increases prolactin release and stimulates uterine, vaginal and mammary growth and differentiation. BPA shares similarities in structure, metabolism and action with diethylstilbestrol (DES), a known human teratogen and carcinogen. This review considers the hypothesis that BPA is converted in vivo to hydroxylated metabolite(s) with enhanced estrogenicity and genotoxicity.",

One chemical found ubiquitously in our environment, bisphenol-A (BPA), has received a tremendous amount of attention from research scientists, government panels, and the popular press. This review have covered the above-mentioned controversies plus six additional issues that have divided scientists in the field of BPA research, namely: 1) mechanisms of BPA action; 2) levels of human exposure; 3) routes of human exposure; 4) pharmacokinetic models of BPA metabolism; 5) effects of BPA on exposed animals; and 6) links between BPA and cancer.",

      "abstractNote": "This article reviews previous studies and presents new data on pesticide exposure in order to provide some indications of the extent and significance of childhood exposure to xenoestrogens, including pesticides, epoxy resins, and polycarbonates. After more than four decades of pesticide use, little is known about their adverse effects on health. There is a need to address the potential risks associated with the current contamination of water, soils, and foods in many agricultural areas. In southeastern Spain, along the Mediterranean coast, extensive areas alongside residential zones are devoted to intensive farming in plastic greenhouses, with the use of large amounts of pesticides. Human tissue samples have been investigated for pesticide residues. Samples of fat from children living in farm areas contained a total of 14 pesticides, including lindane, HCH, heptachlor, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, endosulfan, o,p'-DDE, and o,p'-DDD, among others. Of the 113 samples studied, 43 were positive for one or more pesticides, some of which have estrogenic activity. The number of new substances that mimic the action of endogenous estrogens is increasing rapidly. These endocrine-disrupting chemicals are not restricted to pesticides. Several different compounds used in the food industry, in plasticizers, and in dental restorations are also estrogenic. The few studies that have investigated their effects in humans all indicate that concerns are warranted. If there is indeed an association between zexposure to substances with hormone-disruptive activity and certain disorders of sexual maturation, the incidence of such disorders should be greater in areas where exposure to agents with this activity is high. We used a spatial ecological design to search for variations in orchidopexy rates and to analyze relationships between these differences and geographical variations in exposure to pesticides. Our results are compatible with a hypothetical association between exposure to hormone-disruptive chemicals and the induction of cryptorchidism. Several methodological limitations in the study design make it necessary to evaluate the results with caution. In conclusion, a closer scrutiny is required to determine whether epoxy resins and polycarbonates contribute, together with estrogenic pesticides, to the exposure of human consumers, especially children, to xenoestrogens.",

We conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate whether perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were associated with indicators of sexual maturation in a 2005-2006 survey of residents with PFOA water contamination from the Mid-Ohio Valley. Participants were 3076 boys and 2931 girls aged 8-18 years. They were classified as having reached puberty based on either hormone levels (total >50 ng/dL and free >5 pg/mL testosterone in boys and estradiol >20 pg/mL in girls) or onset of menarche. We estimated the odds of having reached puberty classified by these criteria and the fitted median age of reaching puberty in relation to serum PFOA and PFOS concentrations measured when puberty status was assigned. For boys, there was a relationship of reduced odds of reached puberty (raised testosterone) with increasing PFOS (delay of 190 days between the highest and lowest quartile). For girls, higher concentrations of PFOA or PFOS were associated with reduced odds of postmenarche (130 and 138 days of delay, respectively). In conclusion, our study showed a later age of puberty in this population correlated with PFC concentrations.",

      "abstractNote": "There is experimental evidence of adverse effects of endosulfan on the male reproductive system, but there are no human data. Therefore, we undertook a study to examine the relationship between environmental endosulfan exposure and reproductive development in male children and adolescents. The study population was composed of 117 male schoolchildren (10-19 years of age) of a village situated at the foothills of cashew plantations, where endosulfan had been aerially sprayed for more than 20 years, and 90 comparable controls with no such exposure history. The study parameters included recording of clinical history, physical examination, sexual maturity rating (SMR) according to Tanner stages, and estimation of serum levels of testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone, and endosulfan residues (70 study and 47 control subjects). Mean +/- SE serum endosulfan levels in the study group (7.47 +/- 1.19 ppb) were significantly higher (p < 0.001) than in controls (1.37 +/- 0.40 ppb). Multiple regression analysis showed that SMR scoring for development of pubic hair, testes, penis, and serum testosterone level was positively related to age and negatively related to aerial exposure to endosulfan (AEE; p < 0.01). Serum LH levels were significantly positively related to AEE after controlling for age (p < 0.01). The prevalence of congenital abnormalities related to testicular descent (congenital hydrocele, undescended testis, and congenital inguinal hernia) among study and controls subjects was 5.1% and 1.1%, respectively, but the differences were statistically nonsignificant.

The book documented the detrimental effects on the environment\u2014particularly on birds\u2014of the indiscriminate use of pesticides. Carson accused the chemical industry of spreading disinformation and public officials of accepting industry claims unquestioningly.\nIn the late 1950s, Carson turned her attention to conservation, especially environmental problems that she believed were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result was Silent Spring (1962), which brought environmental concerns to the American public. Silent Spring was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, but it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, led to a nationwide ban on DDT for agricultural uses, and inspired an environmental movement that led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nIn 1996, a follow-up book, Beyond Silent Spring, co-written by H.F. van Emden and David Peakall, was published. In 2006, Silent Spring was named one of the 25 greatest science books of all time by the editors of Discover Magazine.",

      "abstractNote": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is an estrogenic endocrine disruptor widely used in the production of plastics. Increasing evidence indicates that in utero BPA exposure affects sexual differentiation and behavior; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown. We hypothesized that BPA may disrupt epigenetic programming of gene expression in the brain. Here, we provide evidence that maternal exposure during pregnancy to environmentally relevant doses of BPA (2, 20, and 200 \u00b5g/kg/d) in mice induces sex-specific, dose-dependent (linear and curvilinear), and brain region-specific changes in expression of genes encoding estrogen receptors (ERs; ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2) and estrogen-related receptor-\u03b3 in juvenile offspring. Concomitantly, BPA altered mRNA levels of epigenetic regulators DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and DNMT3A in the juvenile cortex and hypothalamus, paralleling changes in estrogen-related receptors. Importantly, changes in ER\u03b1 and DNMT expression in the cortex (males) and hypothalamus (females) were associated with DNA methylation changes in the ER\u03b1 gene. BPA exposure induced persistent, largely sex-specific effects on social and anxiety-like behavior, leading to disruption of sexually dimorphic behaviors. Although postnatal maternal care was altered in mothers treated with BPA during pregnancy, the effects of in utero BPA were not found to be mediated by maternal care. However, our data suggest that increased maternal care may partially attenuate the effects of in utero BPA on DNA methylation. Overall, we demonstrate that low-dose prenatal BPA exposure induces lasting epigenetic disruption in the brain that possibly underlie enduring effects of BPA on brain function and behavior, especially regarding sexually dimorphic phenotypes.",

We hypothesized that maternal exposure to phthalates and BPA in pregnancy is associated with shortened gestation.\nMETHODS: Urinary phthalate and BPA metabolites from 72 pregnant women were measured at the last obstetric clinic visit prior to delivery. Using linear regression models, we estimated the change in gestational age associated with each interquartile range (IQR) increase in phthalate and BPA metabolite concentration.\nRESULTS: IQR increases in urinary mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) and BPA concentrations were associated with 4.2 and 1.1 d decreases in gestation, respectively. When stratified by gender, these alterations were found only in male infants.\nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that MEHHP and BPA (free + glucuronide) are associated with reductions in gestation, with effects observed only in males. Our findings are consistent with the idea that these agents induce gender-specific alterations in signaling via PPAR-\u03b3 transcription factor, androgen precursors and/or inflammatory mediators during the initiation of labor.",

Obesity is currently receiving needed attention since it has potential to overwhelm health systems worldwide with associated illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Here, we review the literature that proposes an association of exposure to environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals with the development of obesity. We describe an animal model of developmental exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES), a potent perinatal endocrine disruptor with estrogenic activity, to study mechanisms involved in programming an organism for obesity. This experimental animal model provides an example of the growing scientific field termed \"the developmental origins of adult disease\" and suggests new targets of abnormal programming by endocrine disrupting chemicals.",

      "abstractNote": "Many chemicals in the environment, especially those with estrogenic activity, are able to disrupt the programming of endocrine signaling pathways established during development; these chemicals are referred to as endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Altered programming can result in numerous adverse consequences in estrogen-target tissues, some of which may not be apparent until later in life. For example, a wide variety of structural, functional, and cellular effects have been identified in reproductive tract tissues. In addition to well-documented reproductive changes, obesity and diabetes have joined the list of adverse effects that have been associated with developmental exposure to environmental estrogens and other endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Obesity is a significant public health problem reaching epidemic proportions worldwide. Experimental animal studies document an association of developmental exposure to environmental estrogens and obesity. For example, a murine model of perinatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol has proven useful in studying mechanisms involved in abnormal programming of differentiating estrogen-target tissues, including reproductive tract tissues and adipocytes. Other environmental estrogens, including the environmental contaminant bisphenol A, have also been linked to reproductive problems and obesity later in life. Epidemiology studies support similar findings in humans, as do studies of cells in culture. Together, these findings suggest new targets for abnormal programming by estrogenic chemicals and provide evidence supporting the scientific concept termed the developmental origins of adult disease. Furthermore, the association of environmental estrogens with obesity and diabetes expands the focus on these diseases from intervention or treatment to include prevention or avoidance of chemical modifiers, especially during critical windows of development.",

      "abstractNote": "Endocrine disruptors (EDs) are ubiquitous in nature. Bisphenol A (BPA, from polycarbonated plastics), genistein (from soy based diets) and 4-nonylphenol (4-NP,\ndegradation product of alkylphenols from detergents) are three major xeno-estrogen\ncontaminants in New Zealand. The estrogenic action of these chemicals has been reported\nin many in vitro and in vivo studies. The mounting evidence from experimental animals on\nincreased developmental anomalies, reproductive disorders, metabolic diseases and cancer\nwhen exposed to these chemicals during development necessitated the examination\nwhether these compounds could be transferred across the human placenta. Hence the aim\nof this project was to to study the passage and actions of BPA, genistein and 4-NP in\nhuman placenta. To achieve this we developed an ex vivo dually perfused single cotyledon\nhuman placental perfusion model in our laboratory. The model was validated by\nmeasuring physical and biochemical parameters. To imitate the environmentally relevant\nconditions, we incorporated the compounds in the perfusion medium from the range of\nserum concentration reported from pregnant mothers. Once the compounds were\nincorporated in the maternal perfusate, dually re-circulating perfusion experiments were\ncontinued for 3 hours with digitally controlled pumps. We collected the perfusates from\nmaternal and fetal reservoirs every 30 minutes for analysing the compounds and their\nconjugates. We standardized HPLC / LC-MS/MS methods to measure accurately the\nconcentrations of the compounds in the perfusates. Our results conclusively showed that\nall these compounds could transfer across the human placenta and reach in the fetal\nreservoir in an active parent compound. However the rate of transfer and the conjugation\npattern varied for these three EDs studied. We also incubated villous and choriodecidulal\nexplants from term placentae with environmentally relevant concentrations of BPA. Our\nresults indicate subtle changes in the expression patterns of key genes involved in\nplacental development. The possibility of altering cytokine secretion could also be\nobserved. Taken together our results showed a materno-fetal transfer of EDs in human\nplacenta with potential in vitro actions. When comparing the available data with our\nresults, the concentration reached in fetal compartment would be sufficient to cause an estrogen receptor mediated effect in the fetus.",

      "abstractNote": "Recently, considerable attention has been focused on certain environmental contaminants\u2014\"endocrine disruptors\"\u2014of industrial\norigin that may mimic the action of sex hormones. Natural compounds and their effects on other types of hormonal activity (eg, on\nadrenal or thyroid function) have for some reason not provoked similar attention. As exemplified by tributyltin and certain bioaccumulating\nchlorinated compounds, available evidence indicates that \"endocrine disruption\" caused by xenobiotics is primarily an\necotoxicologic problem. In mammals, certain phenylmethyl-substituted siloxanes have been found to be by far the most potent\nendocrine disrupters among various synthetic xenobiotics. On the other hand, it has not been possible to scientifically substantiate\neither certain alarming reports of powerful synergistic effects between chlorinated pesticides or the alleged adverse effects on the male\nreproductive tract in rodents (induced by alkylphenols and plasticizers at extremely low exposures). Whereas there is compelling evidence that estrogens in certain foods and herbal medicines can induce hormonal changes in women as well as overt toxicity in\nmen, existing data are insufficient to support a causal relationship between exposure of the general human population to nonpharmaceutical\nindustrial chemicals and adverse effects operating via the endocrine system. Moreover, in terms of magnitude and extent,\nall such exposures to so-called endocrine disruptors are dwarfed by the extensive use of oral contraceptives and estrogens for treatment\nof menopausal and postmenopausal disorders. Also, the exposure to hormonally active xenobiotics is virtually insignificant when\ncompared with the intake of the phytoestrogens that are present in food and beverages, and it is even more insignificant when compared\nwith certain herbal potions used in \"alternative medicine.\" Furthermore, while there has been much concern about negligible exposures\nto xenobiotics with weak hormonelike activities, the potent endocrine disruptor licorice is freely given to children. Long-term exposure\nto this substance induces severe toxic symptoms of mineral corticoid hormone imbalance. Although exposures to xenobiotics and\nmany natural compounds occur by identical routes of administration and may contribute to the same toxicological end point, they are,\nregrettably, judged by completely different standards. As is the case with all other chemicals, rational risk assessment and risk\nmanagement of man-made and natural endocrine modulators must be based on the mode of action and dose-response relationships. Such end points as the induction of reproductive developmental effects, cancer, etc, relating to actual exposures must also be taken\ninto consideration.",

Further, human have significant exposure to phthalates. However, little is known concerning the exposure of wildlife to phthalates. We report urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations from fifty juvenile alligators from three Florida lakes and a site in the Everglades. Urinary phthalate monoester concentrations varied widely among alligators from the different sites but also among alligators from the same site. Mono-2-ethylhexy phthalate and monobutyl phthalate were found in most samples of alligator urine with maximums of 35,700 ng/mL and 193 ng/mL, respectively. Monobenzyl phthalate was found in 5 alligators with a maximum of 66.7 ng/mL. Other monoesters were found in only one or two alligator urine samples. The wide variation within and among sites, in addition to the high levels of mEHP, mBP and mBzP, is consistent with exposure arising from the intermittent spraying of herbicide formulations to control invasive aquatic plants in Florida freshwater sites. Phthalate diesters are used as adjuvants in many of these formulations.",
